## Making an importer

If you are interested in give support for your custom blocks see if the source language is in the list of supported languages (now in alpha state, only JavaScript is partially supported and is a work in progress). If the source language is not supported see [this section](#Giving%20support%20for%20a%20language). If your language is supported see other importers in the `importers/` folder (like the JS Blockly importer) and follow the YOURLANG.md page (JAVASCRIPT.md for example).
